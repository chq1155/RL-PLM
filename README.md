# From Supervision to Exploration: What Does Protein Language Model Learn During Reinforcement Learning?

This repository contains the implementation of the `RL-PLM` framework introduced in our paper:  
**[*From Supervision to Exploration: What Does Protein Language Model Learn During Reinforcement Learning?*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01571)** (Arxiv preprint).

`RL-PLM` provides a unified platform for analyzing how reinforcement learning enhances and reshapes **Protein Language Models (PLMs)** across four biological design systems.  
The framework supports multiple RL algorithmsâ€”**DPO**, **PPO**, and **GRPO**â€”and integrates them with both **auto-regressive** and **masked-language** protein models.
